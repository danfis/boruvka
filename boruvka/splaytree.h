/**
 * Splay Tree
 * ===========
 *
 * A splay tree is a self-organizing data structure.  Every operation
 * on the tree causes a splay to happen.  The splay moves the requested
 * node to the root of the tree and partly rebalances it.
 *
 * This has the benefit that request locality causes faster lookups as
 * the requested nodes move to the top of the tree.  On the other hand,
 * every lookup causes memory writes.
 *
 * The Balance Theorem bounds the total access time for m operations
 * and n inserts on an initially empty tree as O((m + n)lg n).  The
 * amortized cost for a sequence of m accesses to a splay tree is O(lg n);
 *
